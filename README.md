# Slurm on GCP Examples

Here are examples of template snippets used to spin up Google Cloud resources
for typical Slurm clusters.

Examples include:

- [Debian Slurm](example-debian-slurm.md)
- [Running Slurm on arm64](example-running-slurm-on-arm64.md)
- Building a custom Slurm image for arm64 (TBD)
- [Slurm on GPUs](example-slurm-on-gpus.md)

**Please note that these are provided only as examples to help guide
infrastructure planning and are not intended for use in production. They are
deliberately simplified for clarity and lack significant details required for
production-worthy infrastructure implementation.**
